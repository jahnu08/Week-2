V Cost Prediction – Week 2

AICTE Edunet Internship | Domain: AI & ML

📌 Objective

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and build a Machine Learning model to predict the price of Electric Vehicles (EVs) based on key features like range, battery capacity, and charging time.

⚙️ Steps Performed

Loaded and cleaned the EV dataset (ev_data.csv)

Performed data analysis and summary statistics

Visualized data using heatmaps and bar charts

Built and trained a Linear Regression model

Evaluated model performance using R² score and MSE

Predicted EV price for a new vehicle sample

📊 Output

Predicted Price for new EV
(450 km range, 40 kWh battery, 6 hr charge, 150 kmph):
💰 ₹20.52 lakhs

🧾 Summary

In this week’s project, we explored the relationship between EV features and their market price.
After performing EDA and visualization, we trained a Linear Regression model that accurately predicted EV prices.
This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can help forecast EV costs and assist manufacturers and customers in making data-driven decisions.
